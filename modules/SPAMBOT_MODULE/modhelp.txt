<header>::::: Moderation Commands :::::<end>

Moderators have access to a special 'Admin' channel, which they use with the 'spam admin' command. This channel is unlocked and is only to be used for necessary messages, and not for spamming / bypassing other locks.

There is also a 'spam orgs' command, which will send a spam message to orgs only, this is handy for more 'delicate' messages.
